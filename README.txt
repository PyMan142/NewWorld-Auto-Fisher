You will need to change your fishing cast key to "-"

--Packages you will need--
pip install pynput
pip install PyAutoGUI
pip install opencv-python
pip install PyDirectInput

ALSO - If you have problems with the images not being detected, its because they arent a pixel perfect match, this includes

1 - waitingforcast.png
2 - standing.png
3 - polecasted.png
4 - 1.png
5 - f3.png

The rest of the images are using confidence from OpenCV so it should detect those almost every time.

So please look at the images and take your own if needed (PUT UR SETTINGS ON HIGH)

If you needed to install more or ran into problems please let me know
