You will need to install a few packages for this one 

pip install pynput
pip install PyAutoGUI

ALSO - If you have problems with the images not being detected, its because they arent a pixel perfect match. So please look at the images and take your own if needed the "bait fish hook" icon (waiting for you to cast into the water) and the "fishing bobber" icon (while it's casted and waiting for a bite)

If you needed to install more or ran into problems please let me know
